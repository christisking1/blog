In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1). What a statement of creation, and God's mighty hand in its utter and complete totality: lest we forget that God created all things, and gave a creational mandate to Adam to subdue it (Genesis 1:28); and lest we forget that Christ, the second Adam, the infinitely better Man, will by His Spirit and Word working (most visibly) in and through the Church subdue all of the earth in discipleship (Matt 28:18-19, Isa 55:11, Psa 110:1), let us meditate on our Father, who is over all, through all, and in all (Eph 4:6), who was in the beginning, and who now, and forever, shall be, world without end.
